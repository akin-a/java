- 1991      - Sun developed JAVA
- 2006/2007 - Sun released **first openJDK** (free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition , Java SE)
- 2010/2011 - Oracle bought Sun, and release **Oracle JDK**
- In the next decade, multiple vendors created their own versions of openJDK (Microsoft, Azul Zulu, Apple, IBM etc)
- But these JDKs were free
- In 2019, Oracle did a nasty job by making their Oracle JDK as licensed/Paid.
- This brought the other vendors(mentioned down below) of OpenJDK into limelight.
- In fact, I still remember, around 2019/2020, we were hurry burrily adapting to **AdoptOpenJDK** in our project in Infy (Had no idea back then though :P)
- And then in 2021, Oracle surprisingly made the Oracle JDK free again (Exception their support).
- It didnt last long, as they made it priced again in 2023, but a different model of pricing. Based on the number of employers in organization regardless how many of them uses it. Yeah, of course it might have pissed off companies like Infosys, TCS.
- With this uncertainities lately, Gobal JAVA developers have a negative vibe on Oracle.
- Right now (11th Nov,2024) We are using Eclipse Adoptium (formerly knows as AdoptOpenJDK) in LG.

Some famous openJDK vendors,
 - Eclipse Foundation (Adoptium/AdoptOpenJDK)
 - Azul Systems (Zulu)
 - Red Hat / IBM
 - Amazon AWS (Corretto) â€¦ and more
