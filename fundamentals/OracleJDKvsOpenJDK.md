- 1991      - Sun developed JAVA
- 2006/2007 - Sun released **first openJDK** (free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition , Java SE)
- 2010/2011 - Oracle bought Sun, and release **Oracle JDK**
- In the next decade, [multiple vendors](https://github.com/akin-a/java/blob/main/fundamentals/OracleJDKvsOpenJDK.md?plain=1#L14) created their own versions of openJDK (Microsoft, Azul Zulu, Apple, IBM etc)
- But these JDKs were free
- In 2019, Oracle did a nasty job by making their Oracle JDK as licensed/Paid.
- This brought the other vendors of OpenJDK into limelight.
- In fact, I still remember, around 2019/2020, we were hurry burrily adapting to **AdoptOpenJDK** in our project in Infy (Had no idea back then though :P)
- And then in 2021, Oracle surprisingly made the Oracle JDK free again (Exception their support).
- It didnt last long
